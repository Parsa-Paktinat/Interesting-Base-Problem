## üìù Problem Description

The challenge is to find the smallest "interesting base" for a given natural number `n`. An "interesting base" `b` is defined as a base where the representation of `n` consists solely of the digit '1'.

For example, given `n = 7`, the smallest interesting base is `2`, because 7 in base 2 is `111`. While `n = 7` in base `6` is `11`, which also consists of only ones, the base `6` is not the *smallest* such base.

The program's goal is to efficiently find this smallest interesting base for `n`. The important condition of the problem is to find the interesting base of the input number in less than 50 milliseconds.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Constraints

The solution must adhere to the following constraints:

* **Time Limit:** 50 milliseconds 
* **Memory Limit:** 256 MB
* **Input `n`:** The input is a single natural number `n` where $3 \le n \le 10^{18}$. 

## üß™ Examples

Here are the examples provided in the problem description:

| Input (`n`) | Output (Smallest Interesting Base) | Explanation |
| :---------- | :--------------------------------- | :---------- |
| `4681`      | `8`                                | [cite_start]4681 in base 8 is `11111`. [cite: 30] |
| `19608`     | `7`                                | (19608 in base 7 is `1111111`) [cite_start][cite: 30] |
